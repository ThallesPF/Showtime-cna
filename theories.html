            <h1 class="text_titulo"><strong>Theory of General Relativity</strong></h1>
            <p class="main_text_list">The theory of relativity, consists of two main parts:<strong> Special Relativity</strong> and <strong>General Relativity</strong>.</p>
            <p class="main_text_list"><strong>Special Relativity</strong>: This theory, published in 1905, <strong>fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time</strong>. It proposes two key ideas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list"><strong>The speed of light in a vacuum is always the same for everyone</strong>, regardless of their motion. This is a constant, denoted as <strong>'c.'</strong></li>
                <li class="main_list"><strong>Space and time are interconnected into a four-dimensional</strong> continuum called <strong>spacetime</strong>.
                    Special Relativity also introduced the famous equation <strong>E=mcÂ²</strong>, which shows the equivalence of <strong>energy (E)</strong> and <strong>mass (m)</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main_text">The theory has some <strong>remarkable consequences</strong>, such as <strong>time dilation</strong> (time passing differently for objects in motion) and <strong>length contraction</strong> (objects appearing shorter when they move at high speeds). It also led to <strong>the famous twin paradox</strong>, where one twin ages less than the other if they travel at different speeds.</p>

            <p class="main_text_list"><strong>General Relativity</strong>: Published in 1915, this theory <strong>builds upon Special Relativity and focuses on gravity</strong>. Here are the key points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list"><strong>Gravity is not a force</strong>, as described by Isaac Newton, but rather a <strong>curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy</strong>. Objects with mass, like the Earth, create <strong>a "dent" in spacetime</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">Other objects, like <strong>planets, stars, and even light</strong>, follow curved paths in this curved spacetime. <strong>This is why things appear to be attracted to one another</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main_text">General Relativity has been <strong>confirmed through various experiments and observations</strong>, including the bending of starlight by the Sun's gravity (gravitational lensing) and the <strong>precise predictions</strong> it makes about the behavior of objects in strong gravitational fields.</p>
            <img class="apresentacao_img" src="assets/theoriesPU.jpg">
            <p class="main_text_list">In essence, <strong>the theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of the universe</strong> by showing that <strong>space and time are not absolute</strong> but are instead intertwined and affected by the presence of mass and energy. It has had profound implications for physics, astronomy, and our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
