            <h1 class="main_Titulo ">The life of a genius</h1>
            <p class="main_text">Albert Einstein was a <strong>renowned theoretical physicist</strong> who made significant contributions to the field of physics, most notably with his <strong>theory of general relativity</strong>. Here is a summary of his life and his path to developing this groundbreaking theory:</p>
            <p class="main_text_list">Early life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list">Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany.</li>
                <li class="main_list">He grew up in a middle-class Jewish family and showed an<strong> early aptitude for mathematics and science</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">After completing his secondary education, <strong>he studied physics and mathematics at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich</strong>, Switzerland.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main_text_list">Early Career:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list">In 1905, <strong>Einstein published four groundbreaking papers in the scientific journal Annalen der Physik</strong>. These papers are now known as <strong>the Annus Mirabilis papers</strong> and dealt with the <strong>photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mcÂ²)</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">His theory of special relativity, published in one of these papers,<strong> revolutionized our understanding of space and time</strong>, introducing concepts such as <strong>time dilation and the invariance of the speed of light</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main_text_list">Path to General Relativity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list">In 1915, <strong>Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity</strong>, which is a <strong>theory of gravitation</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">General relativity posits that <strong>gravity is not a force between masses</strong>, as described by Isaac Newton, but rather the result of the <strong>warping of spacetime caused by massive objects</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">Einstein's theory was supported by </strong>the 1919 solar eclipse observations</strong>, where <strong>the bending of starlight by the Sun's gravity</strong> confirmed his predictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="main_text_list">Contributions and Impact:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list">General relativity provided <strong>a new framework for understanding the cosmos</strong> and made <strong>predictions that differed from classical physics</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">It <strong>predicted phenomena</strong> such as the <strong>bending of light by gravity</strong> (gravitational lensing) and the <strong>existence of black holes</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">Einstein's equations also served as the <strong>foundation for our modern understanding of the expanding universe</strong>, as described by the Big Bang theory.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p class="main_text_list">Later Life and Achievements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list">Einstein continued to work in academia and research, <strong>holding various positions at universities and institutes</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">He <strong>emigrated to the United States in 1933</strong> due to the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany.</li>
                <li class="main_list">In 1939, <strong>he signed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt</strong>, <strong>alerting him to the potential of nuclear weapons</strong> and urgingthe U.S. to develop its atomic program.</li>
                <li class="main_list">Einstein <strong>received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921</strong> for his work on the photoelectric effect.</li>  
            </ul>
            <p class="main_text_list">Legacy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="main_list">Albert Einstein is considered one of <strong>the most influential scientists in history</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">His theory of general relativity has been <strong>extensively tested and confirmed through experiments and observations</strong>.</li>
                <li class="main_list">Einstein's work <strong>reshaped our understanding of the universe, space, and time</strong>, and his equations remain a cornerstone of modern physics.</li>  
            </ul>
            <p class="main_text_list">Albert Einstein's contributions to science and his theory of general relativity continue to inspire and shape the field of physics to this day.</p>
